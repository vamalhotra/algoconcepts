<p>Greedy algorithms is a technique to make optimal choice at each step such that final solution is also optimal.</p>

<p>For greedy algorithm to work, a problem must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optimal Substructure: Optimal solution for the problem can be arrived using optimal solution to sub-problems.</li>
  <li>Greedy property - If you make a choice that seems the best for sub-problem and solve remaining sub-problems, you will arrive at the optimal solution to the problem. You will never have to reconsider your earlier choices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sample Problem:</p>

<p>Youâ€™re given A amount of cash and you need to buy</p>
