<p>Segment Tree is a very useful data structure to work efficiently with range queries over a n-dimension array. It can be used to answer sum of a given range and update element in the range in O(log N) time.</p>

<p>In list of various  sample applications below, it is assumed we are given an N element array A[0..N].</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>Find sum of all elements in the given range i.e. sum over subarray A[i..j]</p>

<p>Update any element in the array i.e. A[i] = X</p>

<p>Find maximum or minimum element in the given range [i, j]</p>

<p>Find count of occurrence of maximum or minimum element in the range [i, j]</p>

<p>Find count of occurrences of a number in the range[i, j] or find index of k-th occurence of the number</p>

<p>Compute the GCD / LCM of all numbers of given ranges of the array</p>

<p>Find smallest index i s.t. sum of first i elements is greater than equal to X in O(log N) time</p>

<p>Find maximum sum sub-array in given range</p>

<p>Given three numbers (l,r,x), we have to find the minimal number in the segment ‘a[l…r]’ which is greater than or equal to x in poly-logarithmic (O log 2 n)</p>
