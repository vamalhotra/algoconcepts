    <p><strong>Rule of Modularity</strong>: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Rule of Composition</strong>: Design programs to be connected to other programs</p>

<p><strong>Rule of Separation</strong>: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines</p>

<p><strong>Rule of Parsimony</strong>: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do</p>

<p><strong>Rule of Transparency</strong>: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier</p>

<p><strong>Rule of Diversity</strong>: Distrust all claims for “one true way”</p>

<p><strong>Rule of Extensibility</strong>: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think</p>
