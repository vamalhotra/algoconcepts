**Rule of Modularity**: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.

**Rule of Composition**: Design programs to be connected to other programs

**Rule of Separation**: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines

**Rule of Parsimony**: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do

**Rule of Transparency**: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier

**Rule of Diversity**: Distrust all claims for “one true way”

**Rule of Extensibility**: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think
