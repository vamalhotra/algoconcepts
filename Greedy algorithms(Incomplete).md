# Greedy algorithms

Greedy algorithms is a technique to make optimal choice at each step such that final solution is also optimal.

For greedy algorithm to work, a problem must have:

- Optimal Substructure: Optimal solution for the problem can be arrived using optimal solution to sub-problems.
- Greedy property - If you make a choice that seems the best for sub-problem and solve remaining sub-problems, you will arrive at the optimal solution to the problem. You will never have to reconsider your earlier choices.

Sample Problem:

You're given A amount of cash and you need to buy
