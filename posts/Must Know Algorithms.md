Must Know Algorithms

Everything here:  https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-spanning-tree/tutorial/ 

Implementing a Trie. Trie root can contains any no. of nodes. Each of these nodes are root of tree.

Minimum spanning tree

Weighted bipartite matching

shortest-paths (p 489 skienna)

War story for suffix trees (section 3.9, page 94)

See these problems: String matching (see page 628), text compression (see page
637), longest common substring (see page 650)  

What is IndexServe

See these problems related to k-d trees:  Nearest-neighbor search (see page 580), point location (see
page 587), range search (see page 584)  

Topological sorting p. 481

Behavioral Qns:

What makes you different from all others? I can lose badly but not do not let that touch my spirit and my enthusiasm. I can move on despite setbacks.  I am more patient with life, and very rarely compare myself with other, I do feel little jealous when I see the weight of some of the guys in my office, they weigh like 50-60 kgs.
