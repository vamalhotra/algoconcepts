# Amazon Leadership Principles

Amazon may not have the best of reputation about its policies, its treatment of workers, employees and it might be doing lot of things (like competing unfairly against small traders selling on its platform) but there's no denying fact that the company has risen from ground-up to a mammoth corporation and just luck can only take you so far, you need to get lot of other things right to be such a success. Today, we will look into some of the fundamentals of Amazon's success that it strives to live by and I hope all of us will find something of great value in these fundamental principles. 

## Customer Obsession

Obsess about your customers and their trust. Understand their intent, understand their pain-points and help them achieve their goals. Everything that we do in our work life should start with customer-story or customer pain point that we are trying to solve. Have you ever demonstrated this principle and gone beyond your line of duty to help improve customers' experience.

Personal experience: While I was working on one spam related project, we discovered lot of spam originating from a popular blogspot.com domain on one of our endpoints. The spam was really affecting the backend system, so we decided to block blogspot.com domain as at that time only functionality to block on all endpoints existed. I knew it will affect some of genuine users, so I added the new functionality in code to block particular endpoint. We then further analyzed in more detail and found the spam originating due to one of internal functionalities which was resubmitting all the past imported data again and again.

## Ownership

Ownership here means ownership of company. You're not just an employee but owner of the company and you should think of doing things that are good for company in the long term instead of taking shortcuts. Take ownership of the results. Be accountable for what you do. You cannot hide behind the words like someone else told me to do so or I do not know the consequences of it. Ownership also reflects in the career. Smart people take ownership of their careers to achieve success while some people make excuses and expect to be lucky or go into depression. Owners are fighters who fight for the success of their product and make sure it is successful.

Personal Experience: I am happy to say that this is one of the most often used positive word used by my managers. Giving feedback on internal systems and processes is one of the way I like to help the company beyond my assigned area of work.

## Invent and simplify

Complexity kills in hard to understand ways. Strive to simplify your products while making them more innovative. Innovation is the expectation from your daily life. Look for new ideas from everywhere and think beyond.

Personal experience: Any time when I invented or simplified anything? Many. 

## Are Right, A lot

Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

Personal experience: I do not want to boast but I am always right.

## Learn and be curious

Never become complacent and always keep challenging yourself. If you are not at no. 1 position, learn from those ahead of you with GROWTH MINDSET and improve yourself. If you are no. 1 position, beat yourself, otherwise someone else will. Be curious and experiment. Stay curious about new possibilities and ACT to explore them.

Personal experience: That's why I am reading and writing about these.

## Hire and Develop the best

Develop leaders and take coaching junior mentors seriously.

Personal experience: It makes me extremely happy to discuss challenging assignments with co-workers and help them understand something I am working on. I have received good feedback on some of my sessions where people have personally walked up to me after the session and gave positive feedback.

## Insist on the highest standards

Set high standards in every area of your life and strive to raise the bar. " Leaders have relentlessly high standards â€” many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed. "

Personal Experience: Raising bar in one area of life can cause imbalance in other areas of life. Balance is important. Ask your manager what are his views on holistic development of employees so that they do not burn out in short term and become unproductive in long run which is bad for company?

## Think Big

It is better to fail achieving something big than succeed at something smaller to our abilities. 

## Bias for Action

Do not wait for all lights to turn green before you leave the house. You will have enough opportunities for course correction once you're on the path. Have bias towards creating IMPACT.

## Frugality

The easiest way to generate 1M in profits is by employing capital of 1B. It's quite a challenge to do that with capital of just 5M. That's why ROCE in such a good measure of company's performance. Strive to achieve more with least resources. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.  

## Earn Trust

It's not said for nothing that it takes years to build trust and minutes to lose it. Aggressive in action but calm in thinking and speaking so that trust is never lost due to rashful or negligent momentary behavior. Treating every with RESPECT and INTEGRITY is good way to earn trust.

## Dive Deep

Never shy away from getting your hands dirty to reach the root cause of solution. Is writing mails to customer apologizing for delay in order beneath you and a task given to low end customer service team representative? It should not be and you should not stop questioning until you have found root cause of issues. 

Personal Experience: Diving deep is also one of the positive words often used by my managers for me.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and commit

Disagree if you have the conviction and do your best on convincing others to your viewpoint. Do so in an emotionally unattached, matter-of-the-fact manner. Once the debate is over and decision has been made, commit to it wholly.

Personal Experience: Everyday life. Keep the ego at gate and do what is best for the company and stay united in the single vision of the whole team. Do not crib if decision is not all clear to you after you have made your points.

## Deliver Results

Create IMPACT in a timely fashion and despite setbacks.
